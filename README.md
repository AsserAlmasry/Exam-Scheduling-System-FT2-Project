# Exam-Scheduling-System-FT2-Project
 Automating and optimizing the creation of exam schedules for educational institutions

The project leverages a genetic algorithm (GA),  the use of a genetic algorithm can significantly reduce the time and effort required to generate exam schedules compared to traditional manual methods. 

This automation can lead to more efficient administrative processes within educational institutions, freeing up valuable time for staff to focus on other critical tasks. 

Overall, this project aims to enhance the scheduling process, improve resource management, and provide a more balanced and fair exam timetable for all stakeholders involved. 

The dataset used is provided in the repository behind the code.
